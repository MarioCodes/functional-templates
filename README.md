My own ready-to-code templates to start a project directly out of the box or to check for quick references.

## .NET 8 (updated to C# 12)
* `basic-template`: my most simple template, ready to start. You're able to set config at appsettings.json. For really basic features. 
* `crud-memory-ddbb` it's the same as `basic-template` but ready with an *in-memory* database to be able to use Entity Framework Core
* `multi-project` the best one for serious personal projects and interview challenges. this project includes: complete unit testing & coverlet usage *(to see code and branch coverage)*.
  * the main project to open is `Api.Core`
  * this is a template. don't try to run it, as important private info is missing from the repository
* `azure-function`
  * `BasicAzureFunction` basic isolated function which handles configuration for local dev and deployed as Azure Environment Variables. It includes an example for usage of an HttpClient
